# Financial Crises Project

This project explores the economic impact of financial crises on both the U.S. economy and the world economy. The analysis is split into two parts, each using different methodologies to assess the effects of financial crises. Data came from the World Bank economic indicators.

### Part 1: U.S. Economy Impact (Part1US)

In this section, I analyze the economic impact of financial crises on the United States. The analysis includes:

R Script: Detailed data analysis and visualization.

Quarto (.qmd) File: Document containing the analysis, outputs, and graphs showing the impact on key economic indicators in the U.S.

### Part 2: World Economy Impact (Part2W)

In this section, the analysis extends to the world economy, using basic machine learning techniques and clustering methods to explore patterns and groupings in how different countries are affected by financial crises. The final output is a comprehensive report.

### Files:

R Scripts and qmd (Part1US.R/ Part1US.qmd / Part2W.R): Perform the data analysis and clustering techniques.

Final Report (Part2W.pdf): Contains the results and visualizations from the world economy analysis.
