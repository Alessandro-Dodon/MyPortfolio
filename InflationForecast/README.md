# Inflation Forecasting Project

This group project focuses on forecasting inflation using various time series techniques. The dataset is sourced from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis and includes key economic indicators used for modeling inflation rates.

### Methodology

The analysis covers multiple forecasting models, with a focus on both traditional and modern machine learning techniques. The key methods used include:

AR(1) Model: A standard autoregressive model to capture inflation trends.

Lasso Regression: A regularization technique to improve model accuracy by selecting key predictors.

Ridge Regression: Similar to Lasso but handles multicollinearity differently by shrinking coefficients.

Principal Component Regression (PCR): Reducing dimensionality in the dataset and using principal components for forecasting.

### Files
